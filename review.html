Jerry Installed it so it fits very nicely underneath the valance and explained how to fit it properly and said if it needed to be adjusted just called the Shade Shop if we needed help. I appreciate your assistance in picking out the perfect color that matches the woodwork and the wallpaper. I would use your Store if I needed anything else replaced in our home. Thank you so much for your help & assistance.</p>
